# Data description
The data I will be using for this excercise is basically: 

 * A table with Bogotás Localities (pretty similar to New York's boroughs)

* Foursquare's information on nearby venues to the center of the Localities, which will be considered by how many reviews they've got on their profiles (how good their rating is  might be considered as useful side description data but will not be used to further characterize the data).

The ideal ending for this proyect would be to map out the more _digitally relevant_ business in Bogotá (meaning the more with more customer feedback, in this case) and then clusterize them into two or tree ¨trending¨ locations for customers who actually interact with the brands they consume through digital media. And then using appropriate matematical analysis (probably linear regressions) do some useful proyections on how much feedback a hypothetical venue would recieve given its location.
