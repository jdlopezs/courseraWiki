Business Proposal:

As I live in Bogot√°, Colombia and there seems to be a fairly small amount of locatitions registered into Foursquare 
given the size of a city like this (around 8 million inhabitants), which could be divided into either the historically 
representative parts of the city (visited by tourists) or the hip parts of the city (frecuented by the more affluent local people), 
I figured there could be an oportunity in finding out how good and how much is your online feedback going to be, 
sorte by the proximity to those two areas; thus, gaining the posibility of predicting digital relevance of the new venues 
based on location and also characterizing the most referenced hotspots for putting a new business.
