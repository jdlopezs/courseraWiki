# Business Proposal:

As I live in Bogotá (Colombia) and there seems to be a fairly small amount of locatitions registered into Foursquare 
given the size of a city like this (around 8 million inhabitants), which I think could be divided into either the **historically representative** parts of the city (visited by tourists) or the **hip** parts of the city (frecuented by the more affluent local people).   I figured there could be an oportunity in finding out how good and how much is your online feedback _going to be_, sorted by the proximity to those two areas; thus, gaining the posibility of predicting digital relevance of the new venues based on location and also characterizing the most referenced hotspots for locating a new business.

##  Target Audience: 
In Colombia digital marketing is still incipient, most businesses haven't even signed up themselves on google services, so they won't show up on google maps searches! Target audiences could be _businesses outisde the digital market_ so to know beforehand how much revenue they're gonna get from buying digital marketing services, **or** _digital marketing agencies_, to know which are they best locations on Bogotá for tackling new costumers into buying their services.
